Clinical Case Report
Patient: María González

Age: 52 years

Gender: Female

Reason for Consultation:
Persistent fatigue, increased thirst, and blurred vision over the past few months.
Medical History:
Overweight with a BMI of 29.5 kg/m².
Family history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (mother diagnosed).
Previous episodes of hyperglycemia detected during routine check-ups.
No history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
Sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.
Current Symptoms:
Chronic fatigue and lack of energy.
Increased thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination (polyuria).
Intermittent blurred vision.
Unintentional weight loss of approximately 4 kg (8.8 lbs) over the past three months without dietary changes.
Occasional tingling sensation in the feet.
Physical Examination:
Blood pressure: 138/85 mmHg.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
Weight: 82 kg (180.7 lbs).
BMI: 29.5 kg/m², classified as overweight.
Neurological assessment: Decreased sensation in both feet on monofilament test.
Laboratory Tests:
Fasting glucose: 146 mg/dL (normal: <100 mg/dL).
HbA1c: 7.3% (normal: <5.7%).
Glucosuria: Positive (normal: negative).
Fasting insulin: Elevated (normal range).
Total cholesterol: 210 mg/dL (normal: <200 mg/dL).
HDL cholesterol: 42 mg/dL (normal: >50 mg/dL for women).
LDL cholesterol: 135 mg/dL (normal: <100 mg/dL).
Triglycerides: 180 mg/dL (normal: <150 mg/dL).
Observations:
The patient meets the diagnostic criteria for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, as fasting glucose is ≥126 mg/dL and HbA1c is ≥6.5%.
There is an increased risk of microvascular complications, including early signs of peripheral neuropathy.
Mild dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
Therapeutic interventions are recommended for glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction.
Current Treatment:
💊 Pharmacological Management:

Metformin 500 mg every 12 hours, with gradual dose adjustment based on tolerance.
Atorvastatin 10 mg/day to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.
Aspirin 81 mg/day (considered for high cardiovascular risk patients).
🏃 Lifestyle Modifications:

Low-carbohydrate and low-saturated fat diet.
Gradual increase in physical activity (walking 30 minutes per day).
Home monitoring of capillary glucose levels.
Follow-up Plan:
Follow-up consultation in three months to assess metabolic control.
Re-evaluation of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels.
Neuropathy screening using monofilament and vibratory sensitivity tests.
Adjustment of treatment if glycemic control is not achieved.
Physician’s Comments:
🩺 "The patient presents with newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with early signs of peripheral neuropathy and mild dyslipidemia. Treatment is initiated with metformin and statins, emphasizing lifestyle modifications. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to optimize metabolic control and prevent long-term complications."
